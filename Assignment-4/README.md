# Assignment 04

 - Using the WayBackMachine I decided to go to BC racings website. I went back over 12 years of the site and made my way to the current date. I noticed that there was a few factors that remained the same through out the page changes but there was a lot of change. I noticed that there was a lot more stylistic elements added to the page along with more useful functions. Also I noticed that the logo of the brand had gone through a couple of different designs.

 - Using the GIT module was pretty easy to pick up and I think that It will make things a lot smoother when getting into more intensive projects.
