        James is a poet and artist living in New York. When he was
        younger he found his way into a lot of trouble and ended
        up spending 5 years in a maximum security prison. He produced
        a film called "Jamesy Boy" about his hard times growing up and
        the battles that he went through while in and after prison
        poem that I chose was from the ending scene in the movie.
